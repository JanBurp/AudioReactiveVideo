# Audio Reactive Visuals
Processing (https://processing.org/) code for creating visuals that react to audio.
The goal is simple: create automatic visuals while feeding the code with music.

## How to
- Download an install processing (https://processing.org/)
- Open and run the .pde file
- If you like to use other music, just add the file to the data folder and edit the appropriate lines in the .pde file

## Some background
As a musician i'd like to publish music online with some visuals. But i don't want to loose a lot of time creating and editing video material. Here comes my developer's mind... 
So i'm developing this processing code to make visuals for me. Starting simple and growing into more complexity and more interesting visuals.

## Different releases
With the musical project 'Zaagstof', a dutch impro collective, we publish roughly once in two weeks a track on YouTube. With each new track i'm planning to create a new step with this processing sketch to create more exciting visuals. And in the meantime have a nice goal for diving into processing and sound analyses.
You can see examples on the YouTube playlist of 'Zaagstof': https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnF3ON_bf27HfI0NtnziLUvLfZki-_H4

### Releases
- v1.2 - A lot of bouncing balls reacting to the volume and gravity.
- v1.1 - Just a basic amplitude follower that draws two lines shaped within a sineform.
