# Audio Reactive Visuals
Processing (https://processing.org/) code for creating visuals that react to audio.

The goal is simple: create automatic visuals while feeding the code with music.

## How to
- Download an install processing (https://processing.org/)
- Open and run the .pde file
- If you like to use other music, just add the file to the data folder and edit the appropriate lines in the .pde file

## Some background
As a musician i'd like to publish music online with some visuals. But i don't want to loose a lot of time creating and editing video material. Here comes my developer's mind... 
So i developed this simple processing code to make visuals for me.

## Different releases
Each release creates different visuals. Maybe there will be a full-blown release with all different visual options in it.
